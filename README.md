## Updater Card Component

This small application uses ReactJS to render a single business partner card. 

----------------------------------------

### Technology

I decided to use React for a few different reasons when building this app. My overall approach to this project was 'big picture thinking'. More than likely, this card component would be part of a much larger app, which is why I broke it down into smaller stateless functional components. This allows greater flexibility for reuse, as well as making it simpler to add more features in the future. I also find that adding those layers of abstraction makes itmuch less complicated to refactor and test.
