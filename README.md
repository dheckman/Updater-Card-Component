## Updater Card Component

This small application uses ReactJS to render a single business partner card. 

----------------------------------------

### Technology

I decided to use React for a few different reasons when building this app. My overall approach to this project was 'big picture thinking.' More than likely, this card component would be part of a much larger app that will be built with other components that will need to interact with mine. It's another reason why I broke the Card component down into smaller stateless functional components. It allows greater flexibility for reuse, as well as making it simpler to add more features in the future. I also find that adding those layers of abstraction makes it much less complicated to refactor and test.
